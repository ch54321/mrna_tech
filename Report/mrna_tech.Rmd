**The science of mRNA gained a lot of attention during the ongoing pandemic. Two mRNA vaccines have proven their efficacy against Covid-19 and for the first time in history this technology was used to battle a disease on a large scale. This important milestone could mean the beginning of a new era - the era of mRNA based medical treatments. In the following, we show how the technology has developed over time and which countries and companies play an important role.**  

<br>

As Figure 1 indicates, the rapid development of the mRNA technology is manifested in an increasing number of patent applications relative to all pharma patent applications at the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/" target ="blank">US patent office (USPTO)</a> in the past several years. This surge in innovation is likely one reason why mRNA based vaccines against Covid-19 have been developed at a record pace. The success of the mRNA technology in vaccinating against Covid-19 could now lead to new breakthroughs in other areas as well, particularly in cancer therapy. 


<!--A look at the share of mRNA based patent applications in total pharma patent applications (on the world level) reveals that applied research in the field of mRNA started to evolve rapidly only in the past several years.-->

#### **Figure 1: Strong increase of mRNA patent applications relative to pharmaceuticals**

<span style="font-size:0.8em">*Sources and notes: Own estimations of the <a href="https://www.cieb.unibas.ch" target ="blank">CIEB</a> using data on patent applications filed at the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/" target ="blank">USPTO</a>.

Against this background, the question arises which research hubs are mainly responsible for developing this (possibly) breakthrough medical treatment technology of the future. In order to check which country-level pharma eco-systems are the most active ones in developing the mRNA technology, we plot the share of mRNA based patent applications in a country’s overall pharmaceutical patent applications filed at the <a href=https://www.patentsview.org target = “_blank”>USPTO</a>.

#### **Figure 2: Germany has a strong focus on mRNA based technologies**

Three interesting conclusions may be drawn from Figure 2. First, the Western world drives the mRNA-patenting activity compared to big Asian research hubs. Second, until 2014, the USA had the largest (relative to domestic pharma patents) share of mRNA based patent applications at the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/" target ="blank">USPTO</a>. Third, since 2015, Germany’s pharmaceuticals have strongly focused on developing and patenting mRNA based technologies, becoming world-wide the industry that is most focused on developing and patenting mRNA based technologies. Nonetheless, the USA remains the largest mRNA patenting hub where roughly 60% of all <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/" target ="blank">USPTO</a> mRNA patent applications are developed (you can investigate this in the Figure 2 by choosing Share in total mRNA). However, Germany is rapidly catching up over the last three years.

<blockquote>***Germany’s pharmaceuticals have strongly focused on developing and patenting mRNA based technologies***</blockquote>

<br>

In addition to the aggregated country perspective, it is utterly important to identify and acknowledge the world’s leading pharmaceutical organizations in the field of mRNA technology. The following graph presents the 15 firms and universities with the largest number of filed mRNA patent applications at the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/" target ="blank">USPTO</a> between 2012 and 2020. 

<br>

<hr class="hr_red">
#### **Figure 3: Universities play a significant role in mRNA patent applications**

<span style="font-size:0.8em">*Sources and notes: Own estimations of the <a href="https://www.cieb.unibas.ch" target ="blank">CIEB</a> using data on patent applications filed at the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/" target ="blank">USPTO</a> between 2012 and 2020. The data shown in the plot is available on <a href="https://github.com/ch54321/mrna_tech/blob/master/firm_mrna.csv" target ="blank">Github</a>.*</span>

<br>

Most patent applications were filed by Curevac and Moderna, both appeared as vaccine developers during the Covid-19 pandemic, even though only Moderna's ultimately got an approval. 

<div class=bloc_div>
<blockquote>***Universities are very active in mRNA-related patent applications***</blockquote>
</div>

It is also very interesting to observe that there is only one large pharmaceutical firm among the top 15 patent applicants - Novartis. This demonstrates that mRNA based medicine is an emerging technology mainly developed and advanced by startups and small pharma companies. The fact that universities are also very active in mRNA-related patent applications substantiate this impression and highlights the importance of academic research for the emergence of new technologies in general.  

<br>

### **What could this mean for Switzerland? **

The mRNA technology seems not to be in the focus of the Swiss pharmaceutical industry. Instead, the US and, increasingly, innovations from Germany dominate the field. According to an article in the <a href = https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/ugur-sahin-and-ozlem-tureci-on-the-future-of-mrna-therapies target = “_blank”>The Economist</a> by <a href = https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96zlem_T%C3%BCreci target = “_blank”>Ozlem Tureci</a> and <a href = https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/U%C4%9Fur_%C5%9Eahin target = “_blank”>Ugur Sahin</a> (the founders of <a href = https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biontech target = “_blank”> BioNTech SE</a>), in 15 years one third of all new approved drugs could be based on the mRNA technology. Hence, could it be that the Swiss pharma-hub largely is missing out on one of the next big things in pharmaceuticals?
